# Calculate stabilization torques

Here the maximum effort for the panda joints are calculated.

# Joint 2

## Solo

mass = 2.36414
Length = 1
Torque = m_g_(Length/2)
Torque = 2.36414_9.81_0.5
Torque = 11.5961067 Nm

## More joints

mass_up_chain = 2.36414+2.38050+2.42754+3.49611+1.46736+0.45606 = 12.59171
Length_up_chain = 6
Torque=12.59_9.81_3=370.52 Nm
