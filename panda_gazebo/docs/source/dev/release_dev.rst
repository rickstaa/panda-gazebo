Code formatting guidelines
==========================

To increase code quality, readability and usability, we use several language guidelines.

Python guidelines:
    * **Linting:** Please ensure your python code doesn't contain any errors by checking it with the `flake8 python linter`_.
    * **Formatting:** Please format all your scripts using the `black python formatter`_.

.. _`flake8 python linter`: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/
.. _`black python formatter`: https://github.com/psf/black

Markdown guidelines:
    * **Linting and formatting:** Please make sure your markdown code contains no errors and is formatted according to the `remark-lint`_ style guidelines.

.. _`remark-lint`: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint

.. note::
    The :panda_gazebo:`panda_gazebo <>` package contains several :panda_gazebo:`GitHub actions <actions>`, which check code changes
    against these coding guidelines. As a result, when the above guidelines are not met, you will
    receive an error/warning when you create a pull request. Some of these actions will create pull requests
    which you can use to fix some of these violations. For other errors/warning, you are expected to handle
    them yourself before merging them into the master branch. If you think a code guideline is not correct
    or your code structure doesn't allow you to respect the guideline, please state so in the
    pull request.

Pre-commit hooks
----------------

The :panda_gazebo:`panda_gazebo <>` package also contains several pre-commit hooks that can be used to enforce the aforementioned guidelines before a commit is made. To enable these hooks please:

1.  Install `node <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager>`_.
2.  Install `python <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_.
3.  Run ``npm install -D`` and ``pip install .[dev]`` to install husky and the required linters.
4.  Run ``npm run prepare`` to setup the pre-commit hooks.
