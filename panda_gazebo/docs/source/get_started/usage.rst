How to use
==========

The :panda_gazebo:`panda_gazebo <>` package contains three types of launch files: **world**, **robot** and **simulation** launch files.

**World launch files**

World launch files start Gazebo and load a world where the Panda robot can be trained. *They don't spawn the robot*.

    - ``start_reach_world.launch``: World that can be used for training a reaching task.
    - ``start_push_world.launch``: World that can be used for training a push task.
    - ``start_pick_and_place_world.launch``: World can be used for training a puck and place task.
    - ``start_slide_world.launch``: World that can be used for training a sliding task.

**Robot launch file**

The ``put_robot_in_world.launch`` robot launch files spawn the Panda robot in Gazebo and load the required control services. The robot currently contains three control
modes that can be selected using the ``control_mode`` argument:

    - ``trajectory``: The robot is controlled using joint position trajectories.
    - ``position``: The robot is controlled using joint position commands.
    - ``effort``: The robot is controlled using joint effort commands.

.. Note::

    You can test different control modes using the :py:mod:`joint_effort_dynamic_reconfigure_server` and :py:mod:`joint_position_dynamic_reconfigure_server` nodes. 
    These nodes allow you to send joint efforts and joint positions to the robot. To learn more about utilizing these dynamic reconfigure servers, refer to the 
    documentation of the `dynamic_reconfigure`_ and `rqt_reconfigure`_ ROS packages.

    Furthermore, you can explore trajectory control using the `MoveIt! package`_. To enable this functionality, set the ``use_moveit`` launch file argument to ```true``. Once 
    enabled, you can control the robot through the `RViz Motion Planning`_ panel. For detailed instructions on how to use `MoveIt!`_, consult the `MoveIt! tutorials`_.

**Simulation launch file**

The ``start_simulation.launch`` launch file combines the two other launch files to start the gazebo world and spawns the Panda robot.

Usage instructions
------------------

You can launch any launch files using the ``roslaunch`` command-line tool. For example, if you want to start a gazebo simulation
of the Panda robot, you can use the following ``roslaunch`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch panda_gazebo start_simulation.launch
