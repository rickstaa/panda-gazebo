# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Find projects to work on

Projects that are open for contributions can be found on the [issue tab](https://github.com/rickstaa/panda-gazebo/) and will be labelled with the `help wanted` tag. Projects with the `beginner` label are ideal for beginning programmers. If you find a project that spikes your interest, leave a comment. We will then assign you to this project. After you did one project, you will be added as a contributor after which you can attach yourself to projects to work on. You can also submit a feature you would like to work on yourself by by opening [an issue](https://github.com/rickstaa/panda-gazebo/issues/new).

## Forking process

1.  Fork the noetic [repository](https://github.com/rickstaa/panda-gazebo/)
2.  Create your feature branch `git checkout -b feature/fooBar`
3.  Commit your changes `git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`
4.  Push to the branch `git push origin feature/fooBar`
5.  Create a new Pull Request

## Commit instructions

We use husky pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. To enable these hooks please:

1.  Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
2.  Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3.  Run `npm install -D` and `pip install .[dev]` to install husky and the required linters.
4.  Run `npm run prepare` to setup the pre-commit hooks.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/). To prevent errors you are recommended to use the [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) tool.
4.  Update the `CHANGELOG.md`. This is also done using the [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) tool.
5.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Versioning instructions

We use the [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) package for versioning. This tool will automatically increase the version and create a changelog by parsing your commits using the [conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/). This package can be invoked using the `npm run release` command. After you cut a release, you can push the new git tag using the `git push --follow-tags origin noetic` command.

### Linting instructions

We use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) pre-commit hooks to perform some linting and formatting actions. These actions will automatically run when you create a commit. Apart from this also some linting actions are performed by github actions when you create a pull request.
